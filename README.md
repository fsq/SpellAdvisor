# SpellAdvisor
A simple WOW AddOn for advising what's the best spell to cast next.

A small textbox will show up at center-right of the screen, with just one word in it, telling you which is the best spell to cast in order to maximize DPS.

Spell Priority is defined by yourself in code though, so you don't have to keep thinking about it in realtime, just press whatever button this textbox tells you.

Only support Retribution Paladin for now (since I'm currently playing it).

To enable it, simply copy SpellAdvisor folder into [your wow path]/\_retail\_/Interface/AddOns/
